    <p>In early 2021 my brother and I decided it would be a very bad idea to take investment advice from the people of
    the internet. Specifically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/wallstreetbets</a></p>
    <p>This site puts that remarkably stupid idea into practice. </p>
    <p>This site scrapes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/wallstreetbets</a> daily for stock tickers and scores them based on the number of upvotes. Assuming that all the top tickers are likely to be bullish calls we then go out and buy shares to make our portfolio match those percentage scores.  </p>
