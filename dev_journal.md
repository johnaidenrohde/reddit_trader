Got as far as finding my components and am working on downloading a set of the stock symbols to begin my search through
the reddit threads. This isn't working for some reason (probably the url is wrong). Overall, it seems like a fun little
project.

I punted and just added today's list of tickers as a CSV. It should work well enough for now.

I've now managed to get a sorted list of scored tickers. The problem I'm discovering is picking out the symbols from the
text when so many symbols are single letters.
