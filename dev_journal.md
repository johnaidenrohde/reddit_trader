Got as far as finding my components and am working on downloading a set of the stock symbols to begin my search through
the reddit threads. This isn't working for some reason (probably the url is wrong). Overall, it seems like a fun little
project.

I punted and just added today's list of tickers as a CSV. It should work well enough for now.

I've now managed to get a sorted list of scored tickers. The problem I'm discovering is picking out the symbols from the
text when so many symbols are single letters. Solved it using the "$" some people use

- [ ] Take this back in time
- [ ] Chart the trends over time (Top 10 and their score over the last year)
- [ ] Calculate a % of portfolio based on the score
- [ ] Check the share price of each ticker
- [ ] Determine how many full shares of each we can buy
- [ ] Create a way to save yesterdays portfolio
- [ ] Determine the buys and sells we need to get there
